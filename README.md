# Pseudo-Chat

This code was developed to work within Gorilla's HTML5 functionality. The script creates a formatted 'chat window' that delivers scripted messages to the participant, who can then respond in the same interface--just like in any online messenger app. The present script integrates Gorilla's text input bar (rather than presenting its own HTML5 text input bar) to streamline the data-cleaning process.
